        <p>2nd Fairview Scouts does a great variety of fundraisers every year. Some of our more common fundraisers are listed below.</p>
        <ul class="money-list">
            <li>Apple Day: A fundraiser put on by Scouts across Canada around the end of October, Apple Day has been put on by various generations of Scouts over the years. If you are interested in supporting the group, stop by the Shoppers Drug Mart in Fairview on Dutch Village Road to donate- and recieve an apple! More information will be below closer to the date.</li>
            <li>Bottle Drive: One of our best fundraisers, our 2nd Fairview bottle drive is a great way to help out the group- with almost no effor on your part! Have any drink cans, explicitly bottles and cans, left over from the holidays? Simply put them in a bag and put them on your doorstep on the day of the bottle drive and we will come and pick them up! We will even sort the bottles for you! This event usually occurs in early January.  More information will be below closer to the date.</li>
            <li>Quickie Dough: A delicious fundraiser, this event typically takes place in the spring. Members of the group will come door knocking, asking if you are interested in buying any cookie dough. The tubs of cookie dough are cheap, taste good, and don't really have to be cooked to be enjoyed. You place your order, and the cookies generally arrive within a few weeks. More information will be below closer to the date.</li>
            <li>Scout Popcorn: Another classic fundraiser, this event is similar to the cookie dough, and usually takes place around September. Members of the group will come door knocking, asking if you would like to buy some popcorn. Put in an order and we will get it to you in about a month. More information will be below closer to the date.</li>
            <li>Scoutrees: Interested in taking a stand against climate change and environmental desruction while helping Scouting? Scoutrees is thefundraiser for you. All you have to do is donate a few dollars when members of the group come around and we will plant a tree for you. Or, you could buy a tree off us and plant it on your own time. Scoutrees usuallu takes place in May.</li>
