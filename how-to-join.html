        <h2>Why Join Scouts?</h2>
        <p>You should join Scouting because it is a great experience for both youth and volunteers, which will compliment and increase the other skills they are learning throughout their childhood. According to Scouts Canada, the program will help to develop better and more well-rounded children, which will prepare them for success in the real world. While this may seem like an exotic and slightly crazy statement, it is true in nature. Scouting will help youth in a variety of ways; if you don't believe us, come and try it out, and see for yourself the power of Scouting.</p>
        <br>
        <p>It is not only the youth that benefit from Scouting, but the leaders and volunteers as well. Being a Scouter is a fun and engaging experience; there is always something unique and fun happening.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In addition, kids need to get outside! After all these long months in a pandemic, kids need a chance to be kids again. Let's give the kids that chance. Scouting, no matter what section, will provide a huge variety of experiences and memories that your child will retain forever. The more people join, the more fun can be had with everyone in the group!</p>
        <br>
        <p>If this website is not enough to convince you to join Scouts, why not come for free? 2nd Fairview Scouts will allow you to come for 2 free meetings before paying the yearly registration fee. These two meetings should be more than enough time to get to know the group, and to make the great decision to join. If you don't see something you like, it doesn't matter: Scouting is Youth-Led; whatever you want to do, you can try and do.</p>
        <br>
        <p>So come and join Scouts. Click on the link above to register for the year, or come to our Scout Hall at 3524 Dutch Village Road. If you have any questions about joining, don't hesitate to email the Group Comissioner by clicking on the email link below. We hope to see you soon!</p>

        <h2>FAQs</h2>
        <h2>Is There a Cost For Youth? If so, Why?</h2>
        <p>Yes, there is a cost of $230 per youth for the year. Some of this money goes directly to the group to pay for adventures and other activities. The rest goes to the organization for training volunteers, planning jamborees, and many other costs. If you are unable to pay the registration fee, there is assistance available.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>When Are The Meetings? How Long Are They?</h2>
        <p>Beaver Scouts meet on Thursdays from 6:30-7:30. Cub Scouts meet on Wednesday's from 6:30 to 8:00. Scouts meet on Tuesday from 7:00-9:00. There are also other activities like camps that take place on some weekends.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>What Do I Need to Bring to Meetings?</h2>
        <p>You will be informed of anything you need to bring to a meeting the week before by a Scouter. Scouts (and even Cubs) should bring a bag with the <bold>10 Essentials</bold> with them to Scouts every week. A list of the Ten Essentials can be found <a href="./10essentials.html">HERE</a>.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>My Child Hates Camping. Won't They Hate Scouts?</h2>
        <p>Of course not! Scouts can be whatever the youth want it to be; if the kids don't want to go camping, they don't have to. In addition, there are many aspects of Scouting other than camping that your child can participate in; or they may discover a newfound love of camping. If all this is not enough to convince you, the youth do not have to come to any activity that they don't want to. If your child doesn't feel comfortable coming to camps, they don't have to.</p>
        <br>
