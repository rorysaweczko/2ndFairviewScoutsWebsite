         <h2>About Beavers</h2>
         <p>Beavers is for kids aged 5-7. If you have kids of this age, this is the perfect place for them! According to Scouts Canada, Beavers will help to develop better and well rounded children who are better prepared for success in the world. Through the <bold>Plan-Do-Review</bold> method of Scouting and the <bold>Youth Led</bold> style of all sections, leadership and teamwork can be developed. Great Scouting adventures will help Beaver Scouts to share ideas, learn new things, and develop new skills.</p>
         <br>
         <p>Beavers can offer any number of new experiences for your child. Because of the Youth-Led aspect of Scouting, kids can try anything they can imagine. Whether your child likes swimming, hiking, games, movies, or just sitting around at a campground, Beaver Scouts is the perfect place to do this.</p>
         <br>
         <p>Beaver Scouts provides a little bit of everything for young kids. Enroll with 2nd Fairview to help your child grow and learn in many different areas.</p>
