        <p>The 2nd Fairview Cabin is a great cabin near Miller Lake in Fall River. Located deep in the woods, in the heart of Scouts Canada property, the cabin is a great place to enjoy yourself and relax away from the stress of the city. There is an outhouse just across the path, and an included wood stove, meaning it is always warm and dry, even in winter. Many of our camps take place out at the cabin, and you will probably get to know the site quite well if you come and join the group.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Our 2nd Fairview cabin is one of many group cabins in the Miller Lake area owned by Scouts. If you were part of another Scout group, the odds are that you have been to your own cabin at Miller Lake. The cabins are located off Perrin Drive in Fall River, only about 20 minutes from the city, making it easy to access while providing an atmosphere of nature.</p>
        <br>
        <p>If you are interested in learning more about the cabin, join the group and come see it yourself. We are also looking for help with cabin maintenance; anything that you can offer would help. If you are interested in helping out, you can email our Group Commissioner.</p>
