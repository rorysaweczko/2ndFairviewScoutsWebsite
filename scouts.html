            <h2>About Scouts</h2>
            <p>Scouts is for kids aged 11-14. If you have kids of this age, this is the perfect place for them! According to Scouts Canada, Scouts will help to develop better and well rounded children who are better prepared for success in the world. Through the <bold>Plan-Do-Review</bold> method of Scouting and the <bold>Youth Led</bold> style of all sections, leadership and teamwork can be developed. Great Scouting adventures will help Scouts to share ideas, learn new things, and develop new skills.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Because of the Youth-Led aspect of Scouting, Scouts is the perfect experience for any child. Whether you like playing games, building structures, hiking, swimming, exploring nature, or just hanging out around a campfire, Scouts is the perfect place.</p>
            <br>
