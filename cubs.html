            <h2>About Cubs</h2>
            <p>Cubs is for kids aged 8-10. If you have kids of this age, this is the perfect place for them! According to Scouts Canada, Cubs will help to develop better and well rounded children who are better prepared for success in the world. Through the <bold>Plan-Do-Review</bold> method of Scouting and the <bold>Youth Led</bold> style of all sections, leadership and teamwork can be developed. Great Scouting adventures will help Cub Scouts to share ideas, learn new things, and develop new skills.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Cubs offers something for every kind of child. The youth-lead aspect of Scouting allows the kids to plan adventures and other activities that would suit them. Whether your child likes walks outdoors, winter camps, snowball fights, laser tag, exploring museum, or just hanging out around a campfire, Cub Scouts is the perfect place to combine all of these activities.</p>
