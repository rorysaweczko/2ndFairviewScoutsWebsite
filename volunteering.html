            <h2>Why Volunteer?</h2>
            <p>Volunteering with 2nd Fairview can be a fun and flexible experience. Not only are you helping the youth to grow and have an amazing Scouting experience, you are also going to have a lot of fun yourself! Being a Scout leader can not only allow your child and their friends to gain valuable lessons and experiences, it can also allow you as the Scouter to experience the amazing adventures as well.</p>
            <br>
            <p>There are plenty of ways that you can help volunteer with Scouts. Whether you want to take on a more administrative role (such as being a Treasurer or other member of the Group Committee) or playing a more direct role such as going on camps, there is a spot for you in the group. The more volunteers we have, the more flexible the position can be.</p>
            <br>
            <p>We would greatly appreciate your help as a Scouter. The more volunteers we have, the better experience we can provide for the youth. If you are at all interested in helping out, we would love to have you. Just click on the Volunteer Now link to begin your training and recieve more information.</p>
           <br>
           <p>If you are interested in volunteering, you can check out the link above for more information. If you have any questions, you can email the 2nd Fairview Group Comissioner by clicking on the link below. If you have any questions, you might find your answer in the FAQ's on this page!</p>
           <br>
            <p>If you are wondering what kind of activities you might do as a Scouter, feel free to check out our Camping Opportunities page. You can also take a look around the website and check out some of the images to see what kind of experiences you or your child can have. Being a volunteer is just as fun and engaging as being a participant, as you will soon discover.</p>
          <br>
          <p>We hope to see you with Scouting soon!</p>

        <h2 class="faq">FAQ's</h2>
        <h2>How much of a time commitment is there?</h2>
        <p>About 2 hours a week usually. Sometimes there are extra days like camps that we will need your help with. The more volunteers we have, the less everyone has to do!</p>
        <br>
        <h2>What kind of training is required?</h2>
        <p>Wood Badge I is required to be a Scouter. The training can be easily accessed on MyScouts and it takes only 6 hours to complete. The training is designed to help you learn how to facilitate section meetings and adventures, to help to create the best experience for the participants.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Do I Need a Criminal Record Check? How Do I Get One?</h2>
        <p>Yes. For the safety of the participants, you require a criminal record check. This can be done by going to the local police station or by going to <a href="https://www.mybackcheck.com/Public/Login.aspx" class="yellow-link" target="_blank">this link</a>. You also need a Child Abuse Registry Check (which can be done at <a href="https://novascotia.ca/coms/families/abuse/ChildAbuseRegister.html" class="yellow-link" target="_blank">this link</a>) as well as a Vulnerable Sector Check (which can be done at <a href="http://www.backcheck.net/halifax/" class="yellow-link" target="_blank">this link</a>).</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Why Should I Volunteer?</h2>
        <p>This is perhaps the most commonly asked question of all. The answer is simple: we need you! In addition to the needs of the group, being a Scouter can help YOU to accomodate any long term goals you may have, as well as offering opportunities for your own development in various areas such as finance, communication, and management.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Again, if you have any other questions, don't hesitate to email our Group Comissioner. She will gladly answer any questions that you might have relating to volunteering and the group.</p>
